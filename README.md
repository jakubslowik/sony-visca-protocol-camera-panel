# SONY Visca protocol camera management panel

The application uses the SONY Visca protocol commands to manipulate a Sony EVI D30/31 surveillance camera. 

It allows you to change the camera position in 8 directions, change camera movement speed, zoom level, among few other things.

You can run it yourself - the front-end will run on localhost:8080 - but it of course won't work without a proper camera, 
so you cannot see the commands taking effect.

### Here is the screenshot from the application:
